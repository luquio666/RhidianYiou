Hi. How are you?
I know you can't answear to that, or say anything at all, but you will when the time comes.

But focus on this, Im your friend and want to tell you something.
Something about everything, and nothing, and how we get to this point.

The following Im going to tell you will sound out of a dream, or a nightmare.
So I suggest you to think of this is as a dream, so It will be easier to digest.

You know "we"...
"humans"...
Live "our" lifes in a span of time, with ups and downs till the end comes, right?

(...remember to think all of this as/is a dream...)

So as for human concepts and understandings, your life has already end.
So you may think of this as you are in heaven, or hell. And think of me as an angel or a devil.

What I can tell you is that none of that its completly true, or false.
Nor its possibly to explain at you at this point.

And why its not possible to explain?
Your are not ready yet as human by human limitations. But you will.

Think of a human trying to explain or talk to a mushroom, or an ant. Those entities are not evolved enought to understand what you want to say. But you, as human, can create an environment to make those entities to flourish, and eventually in time, that talk between you, the ant and the mushroom will be possible.

Those are the the limitations at this point. I can talk to you, as you can feed an ant. But I cant explain anything to you, as you cant talk talk to an ant.

...

You will wake up of this "dream", as a human, a human capable of understanding more than what language can say. It will take you time, but time wont be an issue for you anymore.
