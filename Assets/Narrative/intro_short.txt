I want to tell you something.

You know we...
humans...
Live our lives in a short span of time, till the end comes, right?

As for human concepts and understandings, your life has already end.

I can tell you thats not completly true, or false.
Nor its possibly to explain at this point.
Your are not ready yet as human by human limitations. But you will.

You will wake up as a human capable of understanding more than what language can say. It will take time, but time wont be an issue for you anymore.

Find me.
